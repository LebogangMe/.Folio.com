                <H2>I JOINED THE 4TH ANNUAL TSHWANE VARSITY HACKATHON</H2>
                <p>  The Tshwane University of Technology’s Faculty of Information and Communication Technology (ICT),
                     in partnership with the Directorate of Research, Innovation and Technology Transfer Office, 
                      launched the 4thTshwane Varsity Hackathon (TVH) on Mandela Day,18 July 2022. It will form part of TUT’s support to the National Development Plan (Vision 2030).</p>
                       
                      <p>
                        The TVH is an annual hacking competition, introduced by Mashitishi Phurutsi, Manager at ICT’s First year and Foundation Unit and Chief Organiser of the TVH in 2019.

                      Partners from industry, the City of Tshwane, and other universities will are  invited to present 21st century challenges that could be used to develop technology-based solutions. 
                      These challenges and ideas will then be captured and put in a backlog. The hackers participating in the competition, 
                      will not know the challenges until the day of the official launch of the Hackathon.

                    <h2>LIFE LESSONS</h2>
            <p> In tthe last 3 years i learned that software development is an industry that offers a flexible way to break into tech. You can work part-time as a freelancer to earn income through a side hustle while you also nurture other opportunities. You can then grow that freelance work into your own business and work solo building web pages. 

                Or, you can join an established team and work with others to collaborate toward<br>
                 something great. Plus, the more programming languages you learn and skills you develop, the more that flexibility ultimately increases. </p>
